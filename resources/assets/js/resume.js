        "summary": "As novel theories and uses of carbon nanotubes (CNT) advance, it becomes increasingly important to characterize the methods of production. One such method of CNT production uses a liquid phase precursor (hydrocarbon with nanoparticle catalyst mix) that is injected into a tube furnace with a flowing carrier gas. The CNTs are grown in high purity and are collected on the surface of the quartz tube. The system allows for a number of variables to be tested such as growth temperatures, flow rate of the carrier gas, precursor injection rates and variations of precursor mix however, here only thermal effects are considered. Under thermal conditions ranging from 500 to 850Â°C, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are synthesized and characterized to determine inner and outer diameter as well as tube thickness."
